# Prework Study Guide Page

## Description

I built the prework study guide as a beginning to understanding some basics of web development like overall project flow and using Github, Gitbash and VS Code. Additionally, I learned how to write some basic code in CSS, JavaScript and HTML in addition to some Markdown syntax. Building the prework study guide page is an excellent beginning to learning and honing the skills required to become a web developer. Apart from learning to write some basic code, I learned the importance of reading technical documentation very closely, working SLOWLY, and ensuring that when I am coding, I am in fact on a feature branch and not the main branch ( :) )

## Usage

This study guide can be used to keep track of notes for each of the coding languages covered so far (CSS, JavaScript and HTML). There is also a section for Git which I am using primarily to list common GitBash commands and their function. It also features a sort of "randomizer" output message in the console which picks - at random - a topic I should study.
